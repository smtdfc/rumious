# Git Commit Guidelines

Always generate commit messages using the Conventional Commits format.

## Format:

<type>(<scope>): <description>

## Rules:

- <type> must be one of: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert.
- <scope> is optional and should represent the module or file changed.
- <description> must be in lowercase and use the imperative mood (e.g., "add" instead of "added").
- No period at the end of the sentence.

## Example:

- feat(auth): add google login integration
- docs(readme): update installation steps
